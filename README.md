# gesture_recognition
Hand detection and count number of fingers using convex hull algorithm .
# skills:
1. python
1. computer vision(using opencv lib in python)
# The steps in the implementation :
1. the video is captured using webcam.
1. calculate average of background for 60 frames.
1. background subtraction and segmentation of hand from frame.
1. then using convex hull algorithm and contours and some mathematics we have to count number of fingers.
